This repository includes some of the codes I wrote for my RA role for a PhD student Tushar Kundu's project at Columbia University.
The project collects data from India and focuses on helping improve students' development by looking at parent teacher communication.

The project looks at three broad categories- social, emotional and academic - that are important for a child's development.
The parents and teachers both rank which of these are most to least importnat for a student's development. We look at different aspects of this.

The parent_edu file looks at parent's education level and relates it with the aspects they think are important for a child's development. 

The teacher_draft and teacher_draft_subject files looks at the gaps between parent's preferneces and teacher's preferences for a student's development and 
aims to determine how different demographic factors for teachers affect that gap.
